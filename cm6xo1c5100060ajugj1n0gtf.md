Let’s get straight to the point.

## The Reality of CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)

To be blunt, the CEH theory exam is underwhelming—just a collection of random multiple-choice questions. Some are so absurd you’ll wonder why they’re even there. (Like, *what protocol does your smart LED light use? Seriously?*) The practical exam? A bit better but honestly way too simple. If you're somewhat familiar with pentesting, you'll clear it without breaking a sweat.

### So, Why Did I Bother with CEH?

Here’s the thing: CEH is a well-known name in the job market—even if it won’t guarantee you a job. Certifications like OSCP and CISSP tend to carry more weight, but some companies still mention CEH in job descriptions. And trust me, no recruiter is going to ask, “Did you take the theory or practical exam?” If you’re keen on adding CEH to your resume, just go for the practical version.

## eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester): A Better Learning Experience

This certification is solid for building real skills. If you’ve done a few beginner TryHackMe rooms, you’ll likely find eJPT manageable. The course, designed by Alex from Hackersploit, offers hands-on labs and covers important topics like Metasploit—arguably one of the best Metasploit courses I’ve ever seen.

The exam? It’s like a Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge:

* 4 Windows and 3 Linux machines (your setup might vary)
    
* You’ll search for flags, identify open ports, perform privilege escalation, etc.  
    The most challenging part for me was pivoting—my connection wasn’t working, so I had to write a batch script to grab the flag. But that’s what makes it fun!
    

**Key Highlights:**

* 48-hour, open-internet, non-proctored exam
    
* You can search online, use tools, and even ask ChatGPT (how cool is that?)  
    It’s an amazing learning experience and a great way to validate your ability to conduct a simple pentest.
    

## So, Which One’s Worth Your Time?

Let’s face it—CEH is expensive and unlikely to land you a job on its own (especially in India). You might get an internship or work as a trainer, but that's about it. eJPT, while not widely recognized, offers better value in terms of learning and skill development.

**If I Had to Do It Again?**

* eJPT &gt; TCM Security Certs & HTB Certs &gt; OSCP
    

  
Invest in certifications that matter. CEH cost me $500 back in 2021—money that would have been better spent on practical, respected certs like PNPT or HTB.

**Bonus Perks with eJPT:**

* Comes with an ICCA voucher
    
* Includes a cloud certification covering basic concepts with lab tasks  
    If you’re getting it bundled, why not take advantage?
    

**Final Thoughts:**  
If you want validation that you can perform a simple pentest, go for eJPT. Skip CEH unless you absolutely need it for a job requirement. And most importantly—never stop learning and practicing.

Best of luck on your cybersecurity journey!
